#### 15 March 2014 - End of life announcement ####
<p>I'm sorry to say this, but as anyone following this project has recognized, it<br>
has not been maintained for a long time and it won't be so in the future. So<br>
Remuco officially is announced to be dead now. It's a bit sad that I could not<br>
find the time to finish my reload I started in private. On the other side,<br>
there are a lot of great remote control applications out there today. The<br>
situation is much better than some years ago.</p>
<p>If anyone is willing to take over ownership, please get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who contributed to this project and sorry to all users<br>
who hoped for an update on this project.</p>
<p>Best, Oben.</p>
#### 3 January 2012 - Development paused ####
<p>As you may have noticed there hasn't been much new code in the Remuco<br>
source for a while and a lot of<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/issues/list'>issues</a> haven't been fixed or<br>
even got answers yet. The reason is that my available time to work on Remuco<br>
constantly decreased. Sorry to say that, but the situation won't get better<br>
within the next six months. This means I'm not able to handle most of the<br>
addressed issues. However, I should be able to integrate well tested<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Contribute'>contributions</a> -- this means fixing problems on your own is<br>
probably the fastest way to get things done.</p>
<p>I definitely do not want to bury this project. Indeed I have a lot of<br>
ideas and already some code for a next major release but I won't be able to work<br>
on this until the second half of 2012.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience, stay tuned (news will show up here, at <a href='http://twitter.com/remuco'>Twitter</a>,<br>
and at <a href='http://identi.ca/remuco'>Identica</a>). At this point I'd also like to thank all<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/source/browse/doc/AUTHORS'>contributors</a> who helped in building a great remote control tool.</p>
<p>See you later this year.</p>
#### 2 January 2012 - Remuco 0.9.6 released ####
<p>Various minor tweaks and improvements come with this release. The report tool to<br>
submit information about supported client devices has been activated again. A<br>
brand new player adapter for the Clementine player is available now.<br>
Additionally there are some fixes and improvements for the MPD and MPlayer<br>
adapters. Finally there is a new client variant for Motorola K1 devices and<br>
enhancements for the Android client. As usual you'll find more details in the<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>release notes</a>.</p>
#### 2 April 2011 - Remuco 0.9.5 released ####
<p>This release includes fixes for the Exaile, gmusicbrowser and Totem<br>
adapter. Check the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>release notes</a> for more details.</p>
#### 17 March 2011 - Remuco 0.9.4 released ####
<p>This release includes a new player adapter for gmusicbrowser. The Banshee<br>
adapter has been updated to work with Banshee 1.6. The Android client has been<br>
improved and is now contained in the release package as a pre-built package to<br>
install on your phone -- no need to build manually anymore. See the<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>release notes</a> for more details.</p>
#### 7 October 2010 - Remuco 0.9.3.1 released ####
<p>This is just a minor bug fix release. See <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>ReleaseNotes</a> for<br>
details. Hopefully we get this release packaged for Debian/Ubuntu.</p>
#### 17 June 2010 - Remuco 0.9.3 released ####

#### 7 June 2010 - Android Client ####
<p>The latest Remuco code now has a basic client for Android devices. Testing<br>
feedback and development contributions are very welcome! Kudos to Florian<br>
for the client and thanks to Olivier for writing some <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Android'>documentation how to<br>
get started with the experimental Android client</a>.</p>
#### 9 January 2010 - Remuco Lightning Talk at 26C3 ####
<p>Igor gloriously coped with the madness of presenting <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=lKp9_GSfkYw'>Remuco in 4 minutes in a<br>
Lightning Talk at 26C3</a> (<a href='http://remuco.googlecode.com/files/remuco-lightning.pdf'>Slides</a>).</p>
#### 6 December 2009 - Amarok 1.4 support ####
<p>There are still a lot of Amarok users who prefer Amarok 1.4 over 2.x. For those<br>
users the next Remuco release is going to have a new adapter for Amarok 1.4. If<br>
you already want to have a try, read the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/BleedingEdge'>instructions for using the latest<br>
Remuco development version</a>. When installing the adapter use<br>
<em>amarok14</em> as player name. <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Issues?tm=3'>Feedback</a> is very welcome!</p>
#### 25 November 2009 - Remuco source mirror at GitHub ####
<p>The Remuco source is now <a href='http://github.com/obensonne/remuco'>mirrored at GitHub</a> (for those of you who<br>
really prefer Git over Mercurial).</p>
#### 22 November 2009 - Remuco mailing list ####
<p>Since Remuco is hosted at Google Code there are some 3 new contributors now. To<br>
improve team communication a new mailing list at Google Groups has been set up:<br>
<a href='http://groups.google.com/group/remuco'><a href='http://groups.google.com/group/remuco'>http://groups.google.com/group/remuco</a></a>. For now the primary focus of this list<br>
is development support and discussions about Remuco general.</p>
#### 18 November 2009 - Follow Remuco on Twitter ####

#### 14 October 2009 - Remuco 0.9.2 released ####
<p>This release introduces 2 new player adapters, for MPlayer and Songbird. The<br>
XMMS2 adapter has been ported to XMMS2 0.6. Minor enhancements in the<br>
Audacious, MPD and Rhythmbox. adapters. Now configurable Bluetooth connections<br>
fix various Bluetooth related issues. Many minor improvements under the hood<br>
... more changes and details in the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>ReleaseNotes</a>.</p>
#### 15 September 2009 - Remuco project migration complete ####
<p>Finally it's done - Remuco is hosted at GoogleCode now. It hurts a bit to say<br>
goodbye to SourceForge. On the other side, whenever I have to use SF for other<br>
projects, I'm happy Remuco has moved.</p>
<p>However, the best thing about the completed migration is that there is time now<br>
to work on Remuco itself again. Those of you who are interested in the<br>
rationale and details of the project migration may have a look at<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Migration'>Migration</a>.</p>
#### 8 September 2009 - Recreated Remuco HG repository ####
<p>Due to a SVN to HG conversion error, the new Remuco HG repositories at<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Source?tm=4'>GoogleCode</a> and <a href='http://bitbucket.org/obensonne/remuco/'>BitBucket</a> had to be recreated. Just don't<br>
care about if you didn't clone the repository before today 14 pm (GMT) -<br>
otherwise please clone again.</p>
#### 8 September 2009 - Migrated source code management to GC ####
<p>The Remuco SVN repository has been converted to a Mercurial repository and is<br>
now accessible at <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Source?tm=4'>GC</a>. More details in the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Migration'>migration<br>
overview</a>.</p>
#### 6 September 2009 - Migrated tracker and forums to GC ####
<p>Open and still relevant tracker items and forum threads from SF have been<br>
migrated to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Issues?tm=3'>GC</a> now. Old trackers and forums are still accessible<br>
for some time but should not be used to post something new. More details in the<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Migration'>migration overview</a>.</p>
#### 4 September 2009 - Goodbye SourceForge, hello GoogleCode ####
<p>We've had enough of using SF as a hosting platform (sorry to say that). Remuco<br>
is going to migrate to GoogleCode. The migration rationale and process are<br>
documented at <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Migration'>Migration</a>.</p>
