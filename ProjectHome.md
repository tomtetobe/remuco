<h4>15 March 2014 - End of life announcement</h4>
<p>I'm sorry to say this, but as anyone following this project has recognized, it<br>
has not been maintained for a long time and it won't be so in the future. So<br>
Remuco officially is announced to be dead now. It's a bit sad that I could not<br>
find the time to finish my reload I started in private. On the other side,<br>
there are a lot of great remote control applications out there today. The<br>
situation is much better than some years ago.</p>
<p>If anyone is willing to take over ownership, please get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who contributed to this project and sorry to all users<br>
who hoped for an update on this project.</p>
<p>Best, Oben.</p>

<h4>3 January 2012 - Development paused</h4>
<p>As you may have noticed there hasn't been much new code in the Remuco<br>
source for a while and a lot of<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/issues/list'>issues</a> haven't been fixed or<br>
even got answers yet. The reason is that my available time to work on Remuco<br>
constantly decreased. Sorry to say that, but the situation won't get better<br>
within the next six months. This means I'm not able to handle most of the<br>
addressed issues. However, I should be able to integrate well tested<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/Contribute'>contributions</a> -- this means fixing problems on your own is<br>
probably the fastest way to get things done.</p>
<p>I definitely do not want to bury this project. Indeed I have a lot of<br>
ideas and already some code for a next major release but I won't be able to work<br>
on this until the second half of 2012.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience, stay tuned (news will show up here, at <a href='http://twitter.com/remuco'>Twitter</a>,<br>
and at <a href='http://identi.ca/remuco'>Identica</a>). At this point I'd also like to thank all<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/source/browse/doc/AUTHORS'>contributors</a> who helped in building a great remote control tool.</p>
<p>See you later this year.</p>

<h4>2 January 2012 - Remuco 0.9.6 released</h4>
<p>Various minor tweaks and improvements come with this release. The report tool to<br>
submit information about supported client devices has been activated again. A<br>
brand new player adapter for the Clementine player is available now.<br>
Additionally there are some fixes and improvements for the MPD and MPlayer<br>
adapters. Finally there is a new client variant for Motorola K1 devices and<br>
enhancements for the Android client. As usual you'll find more details in the<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>release notes</a>.</p>

<h4>2 April 2011 - Remuco 0.9.5 released</h4>
<p>This release includes fixes for the Exaile, gmusicbrowser and Totem<br>
adapter. Check the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ReleaseNotes'>release notes</a> for more details.</p>
